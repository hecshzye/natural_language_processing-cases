#Disaster Tweet Detection using Natural Language Processing

- The goal is to predict which tweets are about real disasters and which are not using NLP and TensorFlow.

- The dataset used in this model is the Real-or-Not from Kaggle competition: https://www.kaggle.com/c/nlp-getting-started/data

- The best achieved accuracy is **81.23%** (model_7)

- A simple use case application is currently being developed & will be deployed soon.
